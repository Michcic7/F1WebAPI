# Formula 1 Web API

A REST API for accessing the data scraped from the Formula 1 official website's standings tab. It includes drivers, teams and race results.

Built with ASP.NET Core 7, PostgreSQL and Docker. The project showcases my 1 year of learning back-end programming.

## Features

- Data ranging from 1950 to 2023
- Pagination with metadata
- Rate limiting of requests
- ProblemDetails responses
- JWT authentication and authorisation with refresh tokens
- Code-first database approach
- Multi-container (Linux) application

## Authentication & Authorization

To register a new user with a username and password using a JSON body:

```
  POST /auth/register
```

To login into an account using a JSON body:

```
  POST /auth/login
```

To refresh the access token using the body returned from the login endpoint:

```
  POST /auth/refresh
```

Tokens lifetime:

- Access token - 10 minutes
  
- Refresh token - 1 day
  

## How to use

With Docker Desktop installed and running, run `docker-compose up --build` inside the `F1WebAPI` folder using CLI of choice.

## Endpoints

To access any of the endpoints, a user is required to have a valid non-expired JWT access token and put it into the 'Authorization' header of the request.

The endpoints give access to 3 resources:

- Driver
  
- Team
  
- Circuit
